**Time Keeper App**

A simple NW.js-based desktop time tracker application written in Vanilla JS.

This is a sandbox application built to learn some of the NW.js fundamentals, as
well as digging into some of the not-so-common concepts and elements of the 
JavaScript language.

You're welcome to fork, adapt, change, extend to your needs and use it to track
the time spent on a daily basis, but don't take the code in here as an example
of good code or good practice of anything! At least, not in its current state.

Also, you can contemplate a giant crab attacking a city in the picture below:
